Social media platforms are undoubtedly the most hype formations of recent years and they increase their sphere of influence by increasing the number of members day by day and by making existing members more loyal users. One of the social media platforms, twitter has successfully emerged as a popular platform for expressing thoughts, opinions, and promoting various entities. The tweets posted on twitter, which is mostly used by individual users and frequently used for exchange of opinions, are valuable to the extent that they reach other users, otherwise the ideas that are not shared do not carry any value. Therefore, the more widely the tweets penetrate, the more the information carried by the tweet will reach the same width, and this will increase the success of the tweet. When a tweet's reader retweets a tweet that he or she has read, the tweet becomes visible to those who follow the retweeter, thus spreading the tweet to a wider audience. The study of how widely a tweet can spread, i.e. how popular it will be, is nothing new and goes back to the early days of twitter. However, we also see that many studies have been done just to make predictions without clarifying the benefit of this prediction to whom. The motivation for this research has been to initiate and conduct this study by targeting audiences who will benefit as much as possible while making predictions about popular tweets. For this reason, the focus is on social media marketing, and the companies that carry out this marketing on twitter have been chosen as the focus group.
